# Super advanced discord bot

RaptorSA is a multi function bot, you can listen music, manage roles, get various informations and many other things. 
This Discord bot can be helpful for anyone who wants to learn how to make a discord.js bot, every command has it's own folder so it's more easy
to read the entire project. 
I made this so new users can also look at the methods used for certain commands and get some ideas for their Discord bot.
When i was developing the bot i was totally new to node js, i did not even know what was an arrow function. At some point 
i learnt discord.js api and node js thanks to various tutorials that i found on internet. In the next days i will publish the entire project.

# Api keys and tokens

Some commands require an Api Key or a token which can be find on these websites: 

* [Google Custom Search Api Key and CX](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/)
* [Riot Games Developer](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
* [Discord Developer to get the token for the bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)

As many of you know i can't provide my Api Keys, because i could compromise my security.

# What do i need to make the bot work ?

* You will need [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for the play, stop and skip commands, as ytdl-core package needs ffmpeg or it will not work.
* Make a folder and git clone this repository: [RaptorSA.git]https://github.com/Cramenorn/RaptorSA.git
